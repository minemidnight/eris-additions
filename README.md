# eris-additions
extend prototypes for eris

require("eris-additions")(eris, options)
eris: the object returned when requiring eris
options (object):
* enabled: array of `Object.Method` stating which prototypes to enable
* disabled: array of `Object.Method` stating which prototypes to disable

only takes either enabled or disabled, if both are provided, it uses disabled

Examples of adding `eris-additions` to your code:
```js
const Eris = require("eris");
require("eris-additions")(Eris, { disabled: ["Channel.sendMessage", "Channel.sendCode", "Eris.Embed"] })
```
or
```js
const Eris = require("eris-additions")(require("eris"))
```

Note: You only need to require eris-additions once, even if you require eris in more than one file.
